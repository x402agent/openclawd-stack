# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Docs: deprecated ClawVault for new deployments in favor of OpenClaw's first-party memory stack, and redirected readers to the official builtin memory and QMD memory docs.

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-03-16

### Changed
- Refactored OpenClaw plugin context injection to use in-process `ClawVault.find()` and `buildSessionRecap()` calls (no CLI shelling in pre-prompt recall path), eliminating SQLite lock contention from subprocess access.
- Migrated plugin session lifecycle recovery/checkpoint flows to direct library calls (`recover` / `checkpoint`) while keeping observer execution on CLI with non-blocking `spawn`.
- Completed plugin-first repository cleanup by removing legacy `hooks/clawvault/` artifacts and dead `packages/plugin/` scripts package.

### Packaging
- Published package metadata now targets plugin-first distribution for OpenClaw extensions.
- Added `.npmignore` exclusions for development-only directories (`autoresearch/`, `eval/`, `benchmarks/`, `hooks/`, `testdata/`, `tests/`, `src/`, `examples/`).

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added
- feat: In-process hybrid search engine — BM25 + hosted semantic embeddings + cross-encoder reranking. `qmd` is now optional. (PR #152, Issue #146)
- feat: Python SDK (clawvault-py) — Python package for PyPI with Vault class, BM25 search, checkpoint/wake lifecycle. (PR #149)
- feat: Inbox + background workers — `clawvault inbox add` and `clawvault maintain` commands with Curator, Janitor, Distiller, Surveyor workers. (PR #151, Issue #127)

### Security
- security: SECURITY.md, exec hardening, opt-in privilege flags for the OpenClaw plugin. (PR #150, Issue #128)

### Community
- Community contributors: @smart-tinker, @ukr-coder, @G9Pedro

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added
- Introduced the new `clawvault wg` command group for Workgraph coordination, including thread lifecycle operations, ledger views, dynamic type definition, and terminal board/status dashboards. (PR #141)
- Added OpenClaw plugin module export wiring (`src/openclaw-plugin.ts`) so plugin entrypoints are resolved directly from built package output. (PR #140)

### Improved
- Expanded context assembly with stronger structured retrieval signals (daily notes, observations, fact-store context, graph-neighbor expansion, profile ordering, and token-budget fitting) for more reliable prompt injection. (PR #141)
- Improved observer compressor handling for OpenClaw message/source prefixes and tool-result noise filtering to avoid low-signal memory pollution. (PR #141)
- Aligned OpenClaw hook/plugin metadata and docs with current runtime behavior and extension loading flow. (PR #140)
- Enhanced LLM provider resolution/fallback behavior and corresponding tests for provider-specific routing paths. (PR #139)

### Fixed
- Resolved CI/typecheck friction by removing dead imports and other low-risk unused code paths touched during the release merge cleanup.

---

## [2.6.1] — 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Moved Gemini API key from URL query parameter (`?key=`) to `x-goog-api-key` request header in both `llm-provider.ts` and `wake.ts`. Prevents key leakage into HTTP logs, proxy caches, and monitoring middleware. Aligns Gemini auth with Anthropic/OpenAI header-based approach. (PR #40, thanks @gupsammy)

---

## [2.5.4] — 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Hardened cross-platform qmd result handling by normalizing URI-derived paths and cache key resolution across Windows and Unix path separators.
- Fixed WebDAV path safety and root containment checks to avoid false 403s and traversal edge-cases on Windows.
- Stabilized cross-platform test behavior for WebDAV temp vault setup/cleanup and shell-init path expectations.
- Corrected npm package `bin` metadata to preserve global CLI install wiring for `clawvault`.

### Improved
- Strengthened primitives reliability baseline: full test suite now passes on Windows (`449/449`) after path portability fixes.
- Updated `SKILL.md` with explicit stability snapshot, `auto` context profile guidance, and clearer runtime verification (`openclaw --version`, `clawvault compat`).

---

## [2.5.3] — 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Canonicalized OpenClaw onboarding and hook setup docs around the required runtime flow: `openclaw hooks install clawvault` -> `openclaw hooks enable clawvault` -> verification with `hooks list/info/check`.
- Removed command-surface drift in top-level docs (legacy `serve`/`peers`/`net-search`, old canvas template flags, and stale compatibility script references).
- Clarified AGENTS.md guidance to append ClawVault workflow instructions instead of replacing existing bootstrap prompts.

### Improved
- Standardized default OpenClaw fallback agent identity to `main` in active observer and hook runtime paths for safer multi-user installs.
- Updated hook and skill metadata/docs to align with current package/runtime behavior.
- Simplified CI and npm script stack to executable, in-repo checks (`typecheck`, `test`, `build`) and removed references to missing compat validator scripts.

### Removed
- Removed deprecated in-repo `docs/` markdown set in favor of the external live docs source of truth.

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-02-15

### Security
- Hardened CLI runtime argument handling for qmd execution by exporting and reusing `sanitizeQmdArg` in `bin/command-runtime.js`.
- Re-validated `--file` inputs through `validatePathWithinBase` for file-backed write flows (`store` and `remember`) to prevent path traversal.

### Fixed
- Audited and clarified command descriptions across `bin/register-*.js` modules.
- Expanded help text default guidance for options where runtime defaults apply.
- Completed help coverage for `inject` and `project` command families, including subcommand and default behavior notes.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-02-15

Two headline features that change how agents interact with their vaults.

### 🧠 Dynamic Prompt Injection (`clawvault inject`)

Agents can now pull relevant decisions, preferences, and rules directly into their prompt context — automatically. Two-layer matching system:

1. **Deterministic matching** (default) — keyword and scope-based rules fire instantly with zero latency. Define rules that match on entity names, categories, or custom scopes.
2. **LLM fuzzy matching** (opt-in via `--enable-llm`) — when deterministic rules miss, an LLM classifies the message intent and finds relevant vault entries. Uses the shared LLM provider (same as observer).

```bash
clawvault inject "How should we handle the Hale deployment?"
clawvault inject --enable-llm "What's our pricing strategy?"
clawvault inject --scope decisions,preferences "brand guidelines"
```

Options: `--max-results`, `--scope`, `--format (markdown|json)`, `--model`, `--enable-llm`/`--disable-llm`.

This is the bridge between passive memory storage and active context engineering — your vault decisions actually show up when they matter.

### 📁 First-Class Project Primitive (`clawvault project`)

Projects are now a proper entity type with full lifecycle management:

```bash
clawvault project add "Site Machine" --owner pedro --client "Hale Pet Door" \
  --team "pedro,clawdious,joao" --status active --deadline 2026-03-01 \
  --repo "https://github.com/Versatly/site-machine" --tags "client,priority"

clawvault project list --status active --client "Hale Pet Door"
clawvault project tasks site-machine
clawvault project board --group-by client
```

Subcommands: `add`, `update`, `archive`, `list`, `show`, `tasks`, `board`.

Projects link to tasks via the `--project` flag on `task add`. `project tasks <slug>` shows all related tasks. `project board` generates an Obsidian-compatible Kanban grouped by status, owner, or client.

Frontmatter fields: `owner`, `status`, `team`, `client`, `tags`, `description`, `deadline`, `repo`, `url`.

### Also Added
- **Pluggable compression backends** — observer now supports Ollama, Minimax, GLM, and any OpenAI-compatible backend via config. No more hard dependency on a single LLM provider.
- **Centralized transition logging** — task state changes write to a ledger (`transitions.jsonl`) with timestamps, reasons, and actor. Ledger write failures are non-fatal.

### Improved
- Canvas refactored to single generator, stripped 4 redundant templates (-2,081 lines).
- Inject: LLM matching disabled by default — deterministic-only unless explicitly opted in.
- Global inject scope treated as unfiltered for maximum flexibility.
- Observer: stabilized pluggable backend assertions.
- Test suite expanded to **429 passing tests across 64 files**.

### Fixed
- Ledger write failures no longer crash task updates.
- Task list metadata visibility preserved correctly.

- **Obsidian Bases Views** — auto-generated on `setup` and `init`:
  - `all-tasks.base` — table + card views grouped by status
  - `blocked.base` — blocked tasks with days-blocked formula
  - `by-project.base` — tasks grouped by project
  - `by-owner.base` — tasks grouped by owner (agent or human)
  - `backlog.base` — backlog items by source and project

### Fixed
- Date handling for bare dates in frontmatter (e.g., `2026-02-14` without time) — `blocked`, `backlog list`, and canvas templates no longer crash on Date objects from gray-matter
- Canvas template descriptions no longer reference competitor products

### Changed
- Default setup theme is now `neural` (was unconfigured)
- Brain canvas template generates 37-50 nodes with architecture-style grouped layout (was radial)
- Project board uses text cards with owner/priority metadata (was bare file nodes)

## [1.11.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Entity-slug routing** — People/project observations now route to entity subfolders (`people/pedro/2026-02-12.md` instead of `people/2026-02-12.md`)
- **Root-level file prevention** — Observations never create files at vault root; always route to category folders
- **Entity name extraction** — Case-sensitive proper noun matching prevents capturing common words as entity names
- **Dedup improvements** — Router uses normalized content + Jaccard similarity to prevent duplicate entries

### Changed
- Router `appendToCategory` now resolves entity-aware file paths for people and projects categories
- Updated router tests to validate entity-slug subfolder structure

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Temporal decay in reflector** — 🟢 observations older than 7 days auto-pruned; 🔴 always kept
- **Exec summary in wake** — Wake command now shows richer context with observation summaries
- **Dedup normalization** — Strips timestamps, wiki-links, and whitespace before comparing for duplicates

---

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Path validation** - OPENCLAW_HOME and OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR now properly validated (trimmed, require absolute paths)
- **Error handling** - `listAgents()` now wrapped in try/catch to handle malformed filesystem state gracefully

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **OPENCLAW_HOME support** - Session utilities now respect the `OPENCLAW_HOME` environment variable for custom OpenClaw installations
- **OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR support** - Also supports `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` for overriding state/agent paths

### Compatibility
- Verified compatibility with OpenClaw v2026.2.9
- Hook handler confirmed working after OpenClaw's tsdown migration fix (#9295)
- Session transcript reading benefits from OpenClaw's parentId chain fix (#12283)

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- **Fixed shell injection vulnerability** in hooks/clawvault/handler.js
  - Changed from `execSync` (with shell) to `execFileSync` (no shell)
  - All arguments passed as array, never interpolated into shell string
  - Vault path validation: must be absolute, exist, and contain .clawvault.json

- **Fixed prompt injection vulnerability**
  - Checkpoint recovery data now sanitized before injection
  - Control characters stripped, markdown escaped, length limited
  - Session keys and command sources sanitized with strict allowlist

- **Removed direct GitHub dependency** for qmd
  - qmd moved to optional peer dependency
  - Users install separately: `npm install -g github:tobi/qmd`
  - ClawVault gracefully handles missing qmd

### Changed
- Hook now validates vault paths before use
- Error messages in hooks are now generic (no sensitive data leaked)

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **`clawvault repair-session`** - Repair corrupted OpenClaw session transcripts
  - Detects orphaned `tool_result` blocks that reference non-existent `tool_use` IDs
  - Identifies aborted tool calls with partial JSON
  - Automatically relinks parent chain after removals
  - Creates backup before repair (configurable with `--no-backup`)
  - Dry-run mode with `--dry-run` to preview repairs
  - List sessions with `--list` flag
  - JSON output with `--json` for scripting
  
  **Problem solved:** When the Anthropic API rejects with "unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks", this command fixes the transcript so the session can continue without losing context.
  
  ```bash
  # Analyze without changing
  clawvault repair-session --dry-run
  
  # Repair current main session
  clawvault repair-session
  
  # Repair specific session
  clawvault repair-session --session <id> --agent <agent-id>
  ```

- **Session utilities** (`src/lib/session-utils.ts`)
  - `listAgents()` - Find all agents in ~/.openclaw/agents/
  - `findMainSession()` - Get current session for an agent
  - `findSessionById()` - Look up specific session
  - `getSessionFilePath()`, `backupSession()` - File helpers

### Tests
- Added 13 tests for session repair functionality
  - Transcript parsing
  - Tool use extraction from assistant messages
  - Corruption detection (aborted + orphaned)
  - Parent chain relinking
  - Dry-run mode
  - Backup creation
