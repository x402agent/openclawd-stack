# Pump SDK Ecosystem

> Everything in the box — what's built, what it does, and where to find the docs.

## Core SDK

**Directory:** `src/` · **Language:** TypeScript · **Package:** `@nirholas/pump-sdk`

The foundation of the project. Builds `TransactionInstruction[]` for every operation on the Pump protocol — token creation, buying, selling, migration, fee sharing, token incentives, and analytics.

### Two Modes

| Class | Mode | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `PumpSdk` / `PUMP_SDK` | Offline | Builds instructions without a network connection. Pure functions, no RPC calls. Use the `PUMP_SDK` singleton. |
| `OnlinePumpSdk` | Online | Extends `PumpSdk` with RPC fetchers. Reads on-chain state, then builds instructions. Requires a `Connection`. |

### Key Operations

| Operation | Method | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Create token | `createV2Instruction()` | Launch a new token on the bonding curve |
| Buy tokens | `buyInstructions()` | Purchase tokens from the bonding curve |
| Sell tokens | `sellInstructions()` | Sell tokens back to the bonding curve |
| Create + buy | `createV2AndBuyInstructions()` | Atomic token creation with initial purchase |
| Migrate | `migrateInstruction()` | Graduate a completed bonding curve to PumpAMM |
| Fee sharing | `createFeeSharingConfig()` | Set up creator fee distribution to shareholders |
| Claims | `claimCreatorFees()` | Claim accumulated creator fees |
| Token incentives | `claimTokenIncentives()` | Claim volume-based token rewards |

### Analytics (Offline)

| Function | What It Computes |
|----------|-----------------|
| `calculateBuyPriceImpact()` | Price impact of a buy in basis points |
| `calculateSellPriceImpact()` | Price impact of a sell in basis points |
| `getGraduationProgress()` | How close a token is to graduating (0-100%) |
| `getTokenPrice()` | Current buy/sell price per token + market cap |
| `getBondingCurveSummary()` | Full snapshot: price, progress, reserves, market cap |
| `bondingCurveMarketCap()` | Market cap from virtual reserves |

### On-Chain Programs

| Program | ID | Purpose |
|---------|----|---------|
| Pump | `6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P` | Bonding curve operations (create, buy, sell, fees) |
| PumpAMM | `pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA` | Graduated AMM pool operations (buy, sell, LP) |
| PumpFees | `pfeeUxB6jkeY1Hxd7CsFCAjcbHA9rWtchMGdZ6VojVZ` | Fee sharing and distribution |
