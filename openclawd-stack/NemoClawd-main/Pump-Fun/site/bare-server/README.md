# Pump Fun SDK Bare Server

A Bare Server implementation for Pump Fun SDK web proxy functionality. This server acts as the backend that fetches web pages and strips restrictive headers, enabling the Ultraviolet client to display any website.

## What is a Bare Server?

A Bare Server is a web server that:
- Fetches web content on behalf of clients
- Strips `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers
- Handles cookies and sessions
- Supports WebSocket connections
- Enables access to sites that block iframes

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - Free)

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd bare-server
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow prompts** and get your URL like: `https://pumpfunsdk-bare.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Railway (Free tier available)

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select this repository and set root directory to `bare-server`
4. Railway will auto-detect and deploy

### Option 3: Render (Free tier available)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. New → Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Set:
   - Root Directory: `bare-server`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm start`

### Option 4: Local Development

```bash
cd bare-server
npm install
npm start
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:8080`

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /` | Server info and status |
| `GET /status` | Health check |
| `/bare/*` | Bare Server protocol endpoint |

## Testing

After deployment, test your server:

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl https://your-bare-server.vercel.app/

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","name":"Pump Fun SDK Bare Server","version":"1.0.0","bare":"/bare/"}
```

## Configuration

The server runs on port `8080` by default, or uses the `PORT` environment variable if set (required for most hosting platforms).

## Security Notes

- This server is designed to work with Pump Fun SDK
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use
- You may want to restrict CORS origins to your Pump Fun SDK domain

## Integration with Pump Fun SDK

Once deployed, update your Pump Fun SDK configuration to use this bare server URL. The Ultraviolet client will connect to `/bare/` endpoint.

Example:
```javascript
// In browser.html or UV config
const BARE_SERVER = "https://your-bare-server.vercel.app/bare/";
```
