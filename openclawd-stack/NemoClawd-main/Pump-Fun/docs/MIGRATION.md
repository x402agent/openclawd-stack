## Upgrading to v1.29.0 (Latest)

> Released: 2026-03-06

### Breaking Changes

**All buy/sell instructions now require additional V2 PDAs.**

The on-chain Pump program was upgraded to require `bonding_curve_v2` and `pool_v2` accounts on all buy and sell instructions. The SDK handles this automatically — just upgrade and rebuild.

```bash
npm install @nirholas/pump-sdk@latest
```

If you're building instructions manually (not using the SDK), you must now include:

| Instruction | New Required Account | Derivation |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Bonding curve `buy` | `bonding_curve_v2` (readonly) | `bondingCurveV2Pda(mint)` — seeds: `["bonding-curve-v2", mint]` |
| Bonding curve `buyExactSolIn` | `bonding_curve_v2` (readonly) | Same |
| Bonding curve `sell` | `bonding_curve_v2` (readonly) | Same (after optional `user_volume_accumulator`) |
| PumpAMM `buy` | `pool_v2` (readonly) | `poolV2Pda(baseMint)` — seeds: `["pool-v2", base_mint]` |
| PumpAMM `buyExactQuoteIn` | `pool_v2` (readonly) | Same |
| PumpAMM `sell` | `pool_v2` (readonly) | Same |

For cashback coins on PumpAMM, `user_volume_accumulator_wsol_ata` is also prepended as a mutable account.

### New Features

- `bondingCurveV2Pda(mint)` — derive the V2 bonding curve PDA
- `poolV2Pda(baseMint)` — derive the V2 pool PDA
- AMM buy/sell instructions now accept optional `cashback` parameter

### Migration Steps

1. Update the package:
   ```bash
   npm install @nirholas/pump-sdk@latest
   ```
2. Rebuild your project — no code changes needed if you use the SDK's instruction builders
3. If you construct instruction accounts manually, add the V2 PDA accounts listed above
4. Test on devnet before deploying to mainnet

## Upgrading to v1.28.0

> Released: 2026-02-26

### What's New

## Upgrading from v1.0.0 to v1.27.x

### Breaking: `createInstruction` → `createV2Instruction`

`createInstruction` (v1) is deprecated. Use `createV2Instruction` instead:

```typescript
// Before (deprecated — will be removed in v2.0)
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.createInstruction({ mint, name, symbol, uri, creator, user });

// After
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.createV2Instruction({
  mint, name, symbol, uri, creator, user,
  mayhemMode: false,  // NEW — required parameter
  cashback: false,    // NEW — optional, defaults to false
});
```

### Breaking: Fee Calculation Signature Change

Fee functions now accept a `feeConfig` parameter for tiered fee support:

```typescript
// Before (v1.0.0)
const tokens = getBuyTokenAmountFromSolAmount(global, bondingCurve, solAmount);

// After (v1.27+)
const feeConfig = await sdk.fetchFeeConfig(); // Fetch once, reuse

const tokens = getBuyTokenAmountFromSolAmount({
  global,
  feeConfig,        // NEW — fetch with sdk.fetchFeeConfig()
  mintSupply,        // NEW — bondingCurve.tokenTotalSupply or null for new curves
  bondingCurve,
  amount: solAmount,
});
```

The same change applies to `getSellSolAmountFromTokenAmount` and `getBuySolAmountFromTokenAmount`.

### New Exports (v1.27+)

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `isCreatorUsingSharingConfig()` | Check if a creator has fee sharing configured |
| `MinimumDistributableFeeResult` | Return type for fee distribution checks |
| `DistributeCreatorFeeResult` | Return type for fee distribution execution |
| `MAYHEM_PROGRAM_ID` | Mayhem program address |
| `computeFeesBps()` | Compute fees in basis points for a given tier |
| `calculateFeeTier()` | Determine the fee tier from token supply |
| `NoShareholdersError` | Error: no shareholders configured |
| `TooManyShareholdersError` | Error: exceeded max 10 shareholders |
| `ZeroShareError` | Error: shareholder has 0 BPS share |
| `InvalidShareTotalError` | Error: shares don't total 10,000 BPS |
| `DuplicateShareholderError` | Error: same address appears twice |
