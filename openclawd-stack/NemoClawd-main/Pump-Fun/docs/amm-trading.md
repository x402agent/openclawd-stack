# AMM Trading Guide

Buy, sell, deposit, and withdraw on graduated PumpAMM pools.

> **Program:** PumpAMM (`pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA`)

## Overview

When a token's bonding curve reaches 100% and graduates, it migrates to the PumpAMM — a constant-product AMM pool. The SDK provides full instruction builders for trading and liquidity management on these pools.

### Bonding Curve vs AMM

| Phase | Program | Price Model | Liquidity |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Pre-graduation | Pump | Bonding curve (virtual reserves) | Single-sided (SOL only) |
| Post-graduation | PumpAMM | Constant product (x·y=k) | Two-sided (SOL + token) |

Check graduation status:

```typescript
const bondingCurve = await onlineSdk.fetchBondingCurve(mint);
if (bondingCurve.complete) {
  // Token has graduated — use AMM methods
}
```

## Trading

### Buy (Specify Token Output)

Buy a specific amount of tokens, with a maximum SOL you're willing to spend.

```typescript
import { PUMP_SDK } from "@nirholas/pump-sdk";
import BN from "bn.js";

const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammBuyInstruction({
  user: walletPublicKey,
  pool: poolAddress,           // Pool PDA for this token
  mint: tokenMint,
  baseAmountOut: new BN(1_000_000),    // Tokens to receive
  maxQuoteAmountIn: new BN(100_000),   // Max SOL (lamports) to spend
  cashback: false,                      // Optional: earn cashback
});
```

### Buy (Specify SOL Input)

Spend an exact amount of SOL, with a minimum token output.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammBuyExactQuoteInInstruction({
  user: walletPublicKey,
  pool: poolAddress,
  mint: tokenMint,
  quoteAmountIn: new BN(100_000),       // Exact SOL (lamports) to spend
  minBaseAmountOut: new BN(900_000),    // Minimum tokens to receive
  cashback: false,
});
```

### Sell

Sell tokens for SOL with a minimum output guarantee.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammSellInstruction({
  user: walletPublicKey,
  pool: poolAddress,
  mint: tokenMint,
  baseAmountIn: new BN(1_000_000),      // Tokens to sell
  minQuoteAmountOut: new BN(90_000),    // Minimum SOL (lamports) to receive
  cashback: false,
});
```

---

## Liquidity Provision

### Deposit (Add Liquidity)

Provide both tokens and SOL to earn LP tokens.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammDepositInstruction({
  user: walletPublicKey,
  pool: poolAddress,
  mint: tokenMint,
  maxBaseAmountIn: new BN(1_000_000),    // Max tokens to deposit
  maxQuoteAmountIn: new BN(100_000),     // Max SOL to deposit
  minLpTokenAmountOut: new BN(50_000),   // Minimum LP tokens to receive
});
```

### Withdraw (Remove Liquidity)

Burn LP tokens to receive tokens and SOL back.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammWithdrawInstruction({
  user: walletPublicKey,
  pool: poolAddress,
  mint: tokenMint,
  lpTokenAmountIn: new BN(50_000),       // LP tokens to burn
  minBaseAmountOut: new BN(900_000),     // Minimum tokens to receive
  minQuoteAmountOut: new BN(80_000),     // Minimum SOL to receive
});
```

## Creator Fee Management

### Collect Creator Fees

Token creators collect accumulated trading fees from the AMM pool.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammCollectCoinCreatorFeeInstruction({
  creator: creatorWallet,
});
```

### Transfer Creator Fees to Pump

Move creator fees from the AMM pool back to the Pump program for distribution.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammTransferCreatorFeesToPumpInstruction({
  coinCreator: creatorWallet,
});
```

### Set Coin Creator

Set the creator for an AMM pool based on bonding curve metadata.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammSetCoinCreatorInstruction({
  pool: poolAddress,
  mint: tokenMint,
});
```

### Migrate Pool Coin Creator

Update the pool's creator based on the fee sharing config.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammMigratePoolCoinCreatorInstruction({
  pool: poolAddress,
  mint: tokenMint,
});
```

---

## Volume Tracking

### Sync User Volume Accumulator

Sync a user's volume tracking data between the Pump and PumpAMM programs.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammSyncUserVolumeAccumulatorInstruction(userPublicKey);
```

### Claim AMM Cashback

Claim cashback earned from AMM trading volume.

```typescript
const ix = await PUMP_SDK.ammClaimCashbackInstruction({
  user: walletPublicKey,
});
```

---

## AMM Events

All AMM events can be decoded from transaction logs:

```typescript
const buyEvent = PUMP_SDK.decodeAmmBuyEvent(eventData);
const sellEvent = PUMP_SDK.decodeAmmSellEvent(eventData);
const depositEvent = PUMP_SDK.decodeDepositEvent(eventData);
const withdrawEvent = PUMP_SDK.decodeWithdrawEvent(eventData);
const createPoolEvent = PUMP_SDK.decodeCreatePoolEvent(eventData);
```

### AmmBuyEvent Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `baseAmountOut` | `BN` | Tokens received |
| `quoteAmountIn` | `BN` | SOL spent (before fees) |
| `userQuoteAmountIn` | `BN` | SOL spent (after fees) |
| `lpFee` | `BN` | Fee to LP providers |
| `protocolFee` | `BN` | Fee to protocol |
| `coinCreatorFee` | `BN` | Fee to token creator |
| `cashback` | `BN` | Cashback earned |
| `pool` | `PublicKey` | Pool address |
| `user` | `PublicKey` | Buyer address |

### AmmSellEvent Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `baseAmountIn` | `BN` | Tokens sold |
| `quoteAmountOut` | `BN` | SOL received (before fees) |
| `userQuoteAmountOut` | `BN` | SOL received (after fees) |
| `lpFee` | `BN` | Fee to LP providers |
| `protocolFee` | `BN` | Fee to protocol |
| `coinCreatorFee` | `BN` | Fee to token creator |
| `cashback` | `BN` | Cashback earned |

## Finding Pool Addresses

Use the `OnlinePumpSdk` to look up pool addresses:

```typescript
import { OnlinePumpSdk } from "@nirholas/pump-sdk";

const onlineSdk = new OnlinePumpSdk(connection);
const pool = await onlineSdk.fetchPool(mint);
```

Or derive the pool PDA:

```typescript
import { poolPda } from "@nirholas/pump-sdk";

const [poolAddress] = poolPda(mint);
```

---

## Slippage Protection

All AMM methods include slippage parameters:

- **Buy:** `maxQuoteAmountIn` caps the SOL spent
- **Buy exact:** `minBaseAmountOut` guarantees minimum tokens
- **Sell:** `minQuoteAmountOut` guarantees minimum SOL
- **Deposit:** `minLpTokenAmountOut` guarantees minimum LP tokens
- **Withdraw:** `minBaseAmountOut` + `minQuoteAmountOut` guarantee minimums

Set these based on your slippage tolerance. For a 1% slippage:

```typescript
const slippageBps = 100; // 1%
const minOutput = expectedOutput.mul(new BN(10000 - slippageBps)).div(new BN(10000));
```
