# Pump SDK — Gemini Instructions

> Unofficial community PumpFun SDK for creating, buying, and selling tokens on the Solana blockchain. Bonding curve pricing, AMM migration, tiered fees, creator fee sharing, token incentives, and vanity address generation.

## Project Overview

The Pump SDK (`@nirholas/pump-sdk`) is a TypeScript SDK for the Pump protocol on Solana. It provides:
- **Offline SDK (`PumpSdk`)** — Builds `TransactionInstruction[]` without a connection (singleton: `PUMP_SDK`)
- **Online SDK (`OnlinePumpSdk`)** — Extends offline SDK with RPC fetchers
- **Rust vanity generator** — 100K+ keys/sec multi-threaded generator
- **TypeScript vanity generator** — Educational reference implementation
- **MCP server** — Model Context Protocol for AI agent integration (53 tools)
- **Telegram bot** — PumpFun activity monitor (10 commands: fee claims, CTO alerts, whale trades, graduation)
- **WebSocket relay server** — Real-time token launch broadcasting to browser clients
- **Live dashboards** — Standalone browser UIs for token launches and trade analytics
- **x402 payment protocol** — HTTP 402 micropayments with Solana USDC
- **Shell scripts** — Production Bash wrappers for solana-keygen
- **Tutorials** — 19 hands-on guides covering the full SDK

## Security Rules

1. **ONLY** official Solana Labs crypto: `solana-sdk`, `@solana/web3.js`, `solana-keygen`
2. Zeroize all key material after use
3. File permissions `0600` for keypairs
4. No network calls for key generation

## Critical Patterns

- All amounts use `BN` (bn.js) — never JavaScript `number` for financial math
- Instruction builders return `TransactionInstruction[]`, never `Transaction` objects
- `createInstruction` (v1) is deprecated — use `createV2Instruction`
- `BondingCurve.complete === true` means graduated to AMM
- Shares must total exactly 10,000 BPS
- Use `BothPrograms` methods to aggregate across Pump + PumpAMM

## Agent Resources

- `.github/skills/` — 28 skill files with `applyTo` frontmatter for scoped loading
- `.well-known/skills.json` — Skills registry
- `.well-known/agent.json` — Agent capabilities
- `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` — LLM context files

## Performance Constraints

| Component | Metric | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SDK offline instructions | < 1ms | Pure functions, no async |
| SDK online (RPC) | 50–500ms | Batch with `getMultipleAccountsInfo` |
| Rust vanity | 100K+ keys/sec | Multi-threaded; use for production |
| TS vanity | ~1K keys/sec | Educational only |

## MCP Server Status

The MCP server is **implemented** in `mcp-server/`. It provides 55 tools, 4 resources, and 5 prompts via MCP v2024-11-05. See `mcp-server/README.md`.

### Terminal Management (MANDATORY)

> **CRITICAL: Every terminal you open MUST be killed after use. No exceptions.**

- **Always use background terminals** (`isBackground: true`) for every command so a terminal ID is returned
- **Always kill the terminal** (`kill_terminal`) after the command completes, whether it succeeds or fails — **never leave terminals open**
- Do not reuse foreground shell sessions — stale sessions block future terminal operations in Codespaces
- In GitHub Codespaces, agent-spawned terminals may be hidden — they still work. Do not assume a terminal is broken if you cannot see it
- If a terminal appears unresponsive, kill it and create a new one rather than retrying in the same terminal
- **Failure to kill terminals is a blocking violation** — treat it as seriously as a security issue
