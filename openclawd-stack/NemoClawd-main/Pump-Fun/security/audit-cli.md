# Security Audit Report: CLI Scripts

**Audit Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Auditor:** Agent 4 - Security & Testing Specialist  
**Scope:** `/workspaces/solana-vanity-address/scripts/`  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL (Private key generation)

---

## Executive Summary

The CLI shell scripts have been reviewed for security vulnerabilities. The implementation demonstrates **good security practices** with room for improvement in a few areas.

**Overall Rating:** ✅ PASS with recommendations

| Category | Status | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Input Validation | ✅ PASS | - |
| File Permissions | ✅ PASS | - |
| Shell Injection | ✅ PASS | - |
| Error Handling | ✅ PASS | - |
| Information Leakage | ⚠️ REVIEW | Low |
| Environment Variables | ✅ PASS | - |

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Input Validation ✅ PASS

**Location:** `utils.sh:is_valid_base58()`, `utils.sh:validate_prefix()`

**Findings:**
- ✅ Base58 character validation is comprehensive
- ✅ Invalid characters (0, O, I, l) are correctly rejected
- ✅ Empty input is properly handled
- ✅ Length checks are implemented
- ✅ Whitespace handling is appropriate

**Code Review:**
```bash
# Good: Character-by-character validation
is_valid_base58() {
    local input="$1"
    for (( i=0; i<${#input}; i++ )); do
        char="${input:$i:1}"
        if [[ "$BASE58_CHARS" != *"$char"* ]]; then
            return 1
        fi
    done
    return 0
}
```

**Recommendation:** Consider adding maximum length enforcement to prevent DoS via extremely long inputs.

---

### 2. File Permission Handling ✅ PASS

**Location:** `generate-vanity.sh`, `utils.sh`

**Findings:**
- ✅ Files created with mode 0600 (owner read/write only)
- ✅ `umask` is set before file creation
- ✅ Parent directory permissions are checked
- ✅ Existing files are not overwritten by default

**Security Controls:**
```bash
# Good: Restrictive umask before file operations
umask 077
```

**Recommendation:** Add verification that permissions were successfully applied after file creation.

---

### 3. Shell Injection Prevention ✅ PASS

**Location:** All scripts

**Findings:**
- ✅ Variables are properly quoted: `"$variable"`
- ✅ No use of `eval` with user input
- ✅ No unsafe command substitution patterns
- ✅ `set -euo pipefail` is used throughout
- ✅ Arguments are passed to `solana-keygen` safely

**Code Review:**
```bash
# Good: Proper quoting prevents injection
solana-keygen grind --starts-with "${PREFIX}:${COUNT}" --output "$OUTPUT_FILE"
```

**Verified Safe:**
- No `eval` usage
- No unquoted variables in dangerous contexts
- No backtick command substitution with user input

---

### 4. Error Message Information Leakage ⚠️ REVIEW (Low)

**Location:** Various error handlers

**Findings:**
- ✅ Secret keys are not logged in error messages
- ✅ File paths are sanitized before display
- ⚠️ Some error messages could reveal system information

**Potential Improvement:**
```bash
# Current: May reveal internal paths
log_error "Failed to write to $OUTPUT_FILE"

# Better: Sanitize paths in error output
log_error "Failed to write keypair file"
```

**Risk Level:** Low - No secret data exposed, minor information disclosure

---

### 5. Secure Deletion ✅ PASS

**Location:** `utils.sh`, cleanup functions

**Findings:**
- ✅ Temporary files are securely deleted
- ✅ `shred` is used when available for sensitive file deletion
- ✅ Fallback to `rm -P` on systems without `shred`
- ✅ Trap handlers ensure cleanup on script exit

**Code Review:**
```bash
# Good: Secure deletion with shred fallback
secure_delete() {
    local file="$1"
    if command -v shred &>/dev/null; then
        shred -u "$file" 2>/dev/null || rm -f "$file"
    else
        rm -Pf "$file" 2>/dev/null || rm -f "$file"
    fi
}
```

---

### 6. Environment Variable Handling ✅ PASS

**Location:** All scripts

**Findings:**
- ✅ No sensitive data stored in environment variables
- ✅ `PATH` is not modified unsafely
- ✅ Script doesn't source untrusted files
- ✅ `VERBOSE` and `QUIET` are properly sanitized

**Verified:**
- No `export` of sensitive data
- Environment variables are validated before use
- No reliance on untrusted environment state

---

### 7. Privilege Escalation Prevention ✅ PASS

**Findings:**
- ✅ Scripts warn if running as root
- ✅ No `sudo` usage within scripts
- ✅ No SUID requirements

---

## Vulnerability Summary

| ID | Severity | Description | Status |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|
| CLI-001 | Info | Error messages may reveal internal paths | Acknowledged |
| CLI-002 | Info | No maximum length on prefix input | Acknowledged |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (None Required)
No critical or high-severity issues found.

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Add Maximum Input Length**
   ```bash
   MAX_PREFIX_LENGTH=10
   if [[ ${#PREFIX} -gt $MAX_PREFIX_LENGTH ]]; then
       log_error "Prefix too long (max: $MAX_PREFIX_LENGTH)"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Sanitize Error Output Paths**
   Consider using basename for paths in user-facing error messages.

3. **Add File Permission Verification**
   ```bash
   # After file creation
   verify_permissions() {
       local file="$1"
       local perms
       perms=$(stat -c "%a" "$file" 2>/dev/null || stat -f "%Lp" "$file")
       if [[ "$perms" != "600" ]]; then
           log_error "WARNING: File permissions may be insecure: $perms"
       fi
   }
   ```
