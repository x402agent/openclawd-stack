OpenShell is the safe, private runtime for autonomous AI agents. It provides sandboxed execution environments that protect your data, credentials, and infrastructure — governed by declarative YAML policies that prevent unauthorized file access, data exfiltration, and uncontrolled network activity.

OpenShell is built agent-first. The project ships with agent skills for everything from cluster debugging to policy generation, and we expect contributors to use them.

> **Alpha software — single-player mode.** OpenShell is proof-of-life: one developer, one environment, one gateway. We are building toward multi-tenant enterprise deployments, but the starting point is getting your own environment up and running. Expect rough edges. Bring your agent.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** — Docker Desktop (or a Docker daemon) must be running.

### Install

**Binary (recommended):**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | sh
```

**From PyPI (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):**

```bash
uv tool install -U openshell
```

Both methods install the latest stable release by default. To install a specific version, set `OPENSHELL_VERSION` (binary) or pin the version with `uv tool install openshell==<version>`. A [`dev` release](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/releases/tag/dev) is also available that tracks the latest commit on `main`.

### Create a sandbox

```bash
openshell sandbox create -- claude  # or opencode, codex, copilot
```

A gateway is created automatically on first use. To deploy on a remote host instead, pass `--remote user@host` to the create command.

The sandbox container includes the following tools by default:

| Category   | Tools                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent      | `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `copilot`                 |
| Language   | `python` (3.13), `node` (22)                             |
| Developer  | `gh`, `git`, `vim`, `nano`                               |
| Networking | `ping`, `dig`, `nslookup`, `nc`, `traceroute`, `netstat` |

For more details see https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community/tree/main/sandboxes/base.

### See network policy in action

Every sandbox starts with **minimal outbound access**. You open additional access with a short YAML policy that the proxy enforces at the HTTP method and path level, without restarting anything.

```bash
# 1. Create a sandbox (starts with minimal outbound access)
openshell sandbox create

# 2. Inside the sandbox — blocked
sandbox$ curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
curl: (56) Received HTTP code 403 from proxy after CONNECT

# 3. Back on the host — apply a read-only GitHub API policy
sandbox$ exit
openshell policy set demo --policy examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/policy.yaml --wait

# 4. Reconnect — GET allowed, POST blocked by L7
openshell sandbox connect demo
sandbox$ curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
Anything added dilutes everything else.

sandbox$ curl -sS -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/issues -d '{"title":"oops"}'
{"error":"policy_denied","detail":"POST /repos/octocat/hello-world/issues not permitted by policy"}
```

See the [full walkthrough](examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/) or run the automated demo:

```bash
bash examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/demo.sh
```

## How It Works

OpenShell isolates each sandbox in its own container with policy-enforced egress routing. A lightweight gateway coordinates sandbox lifecycle, and every outbound connection is intercepted by the policy engine, which does one of three things:

- **Allows** — the destination and binary match a policy block.
- **Routes for inference** — strips caller credentials, injects backend credentials, and forwards to the managed model.
- **Denies** — blocks the request and logs it.

| Component          | Role                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gateway**        | Control-plane API that coordinates sandbox lifecycle and acts as the auth boundary.          |
| **Sandbox**        | Isolated runtime with container supervision and policy-enforced egress routing.              |
| **Policy Engine**  | Enforces filesystem, network, and process constraints from application layer down to kernel. |
| **Privacy Router** | Privacy-aware LLM routing that keeps sensitive context on sandbox compute.                   |

Under the hood, all these components run as a [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes cluster inside a single Docker container — no separate K8s install required. The `openshell gateway` commands take care of provisioning the container and cluster.

## Protection Layers

OpenShell applies defense in depth across four policy domains:

| Layer      | What it protects                                    | When it applies             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Filesystem | Prevents reads/writes outside allowed paths.        | Locked at sandbox creation. |
| Network    | Blocks unauthorized outbound connections.           | Hot-reloadable at runtime.  |
| Process    | Blocks privilege escalation and dangerous syscalls. | Locked at sandbox creation. |
| Inference  | Reroutes model API calls to controlled backends.    | Hot-reloadable at runtime.  |

Policies are declarative YAML files. Static sections (filesystem, process) are locked at creation; dynamic sections (network, inference) can be hot-reloaded on a running sandbox with `openshell policy set`.

## Providers

Agents need credentials — API keys, tokens, service accounts. OpenShell manages these as **providers**: named credential bundles that are injected into sandboxes at creation. The CLI auto-discovers credentials for recognized agents (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot) from your shell environment, or you can create providers explicitly with `openshell provider create`. Credentials never leak into the sandbox filesystem; they are injected as environment variables at runtime.

## GPU Support (Experimental)

> **Experimental** — GPU passthrough works on supported hosts but is under active development. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.

OpenShell can pass host GPUs into sandboxes for local inference, fine-tuning, or any GPU workload. Add `--gpu` when creating a sandbox:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --gpu --from [gpu-enabled-sandbox] -- claude
```

The CLI auto-bootstraps a GPU-enabled gateway on first use, auto-selecting CDI when available and otherwise falling back to Docker's NVIDIA GPU request path (`--gpus all`). GPU intent is also inferred automatically for community images with `gpu` in the name.

**Requirements:** NVIDIA drivers and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) must be installed on the host. The sandbox image itself must include the appropriate GPU drivers and libraries for your workload — the default `base` image does not. See the [BYOC example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/main/examples/bring-your-own-container) for building a custom sandbox image with GPU support.

## Terminal UI

OpenShell includes a real-time terminal dashboard for monitoring gateways, sandboxes, and providers — inspired by [k9s](https://k9scli.io/).

```bash
openshell term
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/assets/images/openshell-terminal.png" alt="OpenShell Terminal UI">
</p>

The TUI gives you a live, keyboard-driven view of your cluster. Navigate with `Tab` to switch panels, `j`/`k` to move through lists, `Enter` to select, and `:` for command mode. Cluster health and sandbox status auto-refresh every two seconds.

## Community Sandboxes and BYOC

Use `--from` to create sandboxes from the [OpenShell Community](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community) catalog, a local directory, or a container image:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from openclaw           # community catalog
openshell sandbox create --from ./my-sandbox-dir   # local Dockerfile
openshell sandbox create --from registry.io/img:v1 # container image
```

See the [community sandboxes](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest/sandboxes/community-sandboxes) catalog and the [BYOC example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/main/examples/bring-your-own-container) for details.

## Explore with Your Agent

Clone the repo and point your coding agent at it. The project includes agent skills that can answer questions, walk you through workflows, and diagnose problems — no issue filing required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell.git   # or git@github.com:NVIDIA/OpenShell.git
cd OpenShell
# Point your agent here — it will discover the skills in .agents/skills/ automatically
```

Your agent can load skills for CLI usage (`openshell-cli`), cluster troubleshooting (`debug-openshell-cluster`), inference troubleshooting (`debug-inference`), policy generation (`generate-sandbox-policy`), and more. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full skills table.

## Built With Agents

OpenShell is developed using the same agent-driven workflows it enables. The `.agents/skills/` directory contains workflow automation that powers the project's development cycle:

- **Spike and build:** Investigate a problem with `create-spike`, then implement it with `build-from-issue` once a human approves.
- **Triage and route:** Community issues are assessed with `triage-issue`, classified, and routed into the spike-build pipeline.
- **Security review:** `review-security-issue` produces a severity assessment and remediation plan. `fix-security-issue` implements it.
- **Policy authoring:** `generate-sandbox-policy` creates YAML policies from plain-language requirements or API documentation.

All implementation work is human-gated — agents propose plans, humans approve, agents build. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full workflow chain documentation.
